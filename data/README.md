### Adding data
Download the data from Yahoo Finance! historical price. You can use other similar sources of data and adjust the `util` file accordingly.
The `util` file assumes you atleast have `SPY` index so have that included just for reference. 

### File names
All files names should follow the pattern `SYMBOL.csv` e.g. `MSFT.csv`, `GOOG.csv` This makes for easy reference in notebooks
